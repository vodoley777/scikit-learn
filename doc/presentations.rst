scikit-learn MOOC
=================

If you are new to scikit-learn, or looking to strengthen your understanding,
we highly recommend the **scikit-learn MOOC (Massive Open Online Course)**.

This comprehensive course, hosted on `FUN platform
<https://www.fun-mooc.fr/en/courses/machine-learning-python-scikit-learn/>`_,
is designed to help learners of all levels master
machine learning concepts and techniques using scikit-learn. It covers everything
from the fundamental concepts of machine learning to more advanced topics like
predictive modeling pipelines and model evaluation.

The course features interactive content, exercises, detailed explanations,
and discussion forum to help you build a solid foundation in scikit-learn
while applying it to real-world datasets.

The MOOC is free of charge, all the course materials are available at:

`<https://inria.github.io/scikit-learn-mooc/>`_.

The videos are available as a YouTube playlist on the Inria Learning Lab channel:

New to Scientific Python?
==========================
For those that are still new to the scientific Python ecosystem, we highly
recommend the `Python Scientific Lecture Notes
<https://scipy-lectures.org>`_. This will help you find your footing a
bit and will definitely improve your scikit-learn experience.  A basic
understanding of NumPy arrays is recommended to make the most of scikit-learn.

External Tutorials
===================

There are several online tutorials available which are geared toward
specific subject areas:

- `Machine Learning for NeuroImaging in Python <https://nilearn.github.io/>`_
